# About meows.space

## Our Story

The journey began almost 15 years ago under the name "mfacil" (from Portuguese "muito fácil" meaning "too easy"). Life, work, and various priorities kept the project in waiting, but the vision remained alive. Today, that vision has evolved into meows.space, carrying forward the same core purpose: helping humanity regain precious moments from their daily digital lives.

## What We Stand For

In a world where major tech companies compete to own your browser's homepage and new tab experience, meows.space offers something different. We believe in a free, democratic web where your digital identity travels with you. No matter which device you use, your personal space should be truly yours – just log in, and you're home.

## The Team

meows.space is developed by [Bruno Palma](https://github.com/m3auuu) and [Gustavo Nips](https://github.com/gustavonips) under the Open Wings banner. This project stands as a tribute to our friend [Maurício Chicalski](https://github.com/mchicalski), whose passion for technology inspired us all to pursue software engineering. While Maurício is no longer with us, completing this project honors his memory and the impact he had on our lives.

## Community & Support

meows.space is and will remain a non-profit initiative. We're not here to monetize your browsing experience – we're here to liberate it. The platform is supported by our community through contributions to the open-source codebase, participation in discussions, and occasional donations that help keep our servers running and our domain active.

If you'd like to be part of this journey, join our discussions, contribute to the code, or support us in keeping the lights on. Every contribution, whether it's your time, expertise, or support, helps make the web a little more open and a little more personal.
