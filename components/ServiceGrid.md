# ServiceGrid Component

The ServiceGrid displays commands as Windows 95-style icons in a grid layout. It serves as the primary visual interface for browsing and accessing commands.

## Structure

The ServiceGrid implements a responsive grid layout with the following features:

- Virtual grid rendering for performance optimization
- Icon display with labels underneath
- Visual indicators for command type and status
- Context menus for command actions

## Functionality

### Virtual Rendering

The grid uses windowed rendering that creates DOM elements only for items in the viewport, providing:

- Consistent performance with large command sets
- Reduced memory usage
- Smooth scrolling experience

### Icon Display

Each command is represented by an icon with:

- Automatically fetched domain favicon or custom icon
- Command name displayed underneath
- Visual indicators for command type (static/dynamic)
- Status indicators (public/private, new, updated)

### Context Menus

Right-clicking on icons provides context menus with actions:

- Edit command
- Delete command
- Duplicate command
- Add to favorites
- Share command
- View usage statistics

### Interaction

The grid supports several interaction patterns:

- Click to execute command
- Drag-and-drop for organization
- Multi-select for batch operations
- Hover for command details
